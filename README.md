# Protein Tracker iOS app

lil project in early stages of development. getting back into lifting lately and wanted a super minimal app for making sure i'm getting enough protein each day.


## Roadmap

- v0
    - one screen with a text field, button, and text where you can input some quanitity of protein you just ate
    - a second screen with a graph view to track protein intake trends over time
- v1
    - one screen for protein input
        - manually input protein quantity with option to include food the protein is from, OR
        - look up food via nutrition search interface or barcode scan
         
    - second screen for graph view

- v3
    - integrate GPT api call to allow users to guesstimate their protein intake for an entry
        - ex: user inputs "one banana, small chicken breast, whole milk, and one scoop whey protein powder" -> gpt estimates protein amount of the meal
